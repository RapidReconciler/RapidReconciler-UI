/*
 * RRV8 — runtime configuration
 *
 * The COMMITTED version of this file is the DEV config: mode = 'staging'
 * so the dev workflow exercises the live RR data-services agent. This is
 * the V8 agent-first tenet (see feedback_v8_agent_first.md in memory):
 * snapshots exist as a deployment artifact, not as the dev mode. To
 * intentionally read from snapshots (e.g. when the agent is offline or
 * for an external reader on GitHub Pages), append `?mode=demo` to the
 * URL. Customer-facing prod deploys overwrite this file at publish time
 * with their own `window.RR_CONFIG` block — the HTML stays byte-identical
 * between environments.
 *
 * Precedence at boot:
 *   1. ?mode= URL parameter wins (engineer / QA override)
 *   2. window.RR_CONFIG.mode below
 *   3. 'demo' fallback
 *
 * Field reference:
 *   mode          — 'demo' | 'staging' | 'prod'. Drives every IS_DEMO
 *                   branch in the page.
 *   authBase      — VALC login endpoint root. Null = use the per-mode
 *                   default from RR_AUTH_BASES at boot:
 *                     staging → https://staging-valcspa.cloudapp.net
 *                     prod    → https://rr-valc-spa.cloudapp.net
 *                   Set explicitly here to override (e.g. a local
 *                   mock VALC for offline testing).
 *   dataPath      — only used in demo mode. Where to fetch the static
 *                   JSON snapshots from. Relative to the HTML.
 *   statusPollMs  — interval for re-checking the SQL Agent job status
 *                   (System Status light). null = don't poll. Prod
 *                   default: 60000 (1 minute).
 *   testAgentBase — base URL of the green-field per-DB data-services
 *                   test agent (RapidReconciler-Agent). The four
 *                   endpoints it owns (inventory/reconciliation/rows,
 *                   inventory/reconciliation/history,
 *                   inventory/audit-detail,
 *                   inventory/variance-component) are routed here in
 *                   staging/prod mode while v359 keeps the rest at
 *                   activeDb.ip. Set to null on a customer install
 *                   that doesn't run the test agent yet.
 *   release       — version label shown in the user menu.
 *   buildStamp    — date the deploy was cut; surfaces in diagnostics.
 *
 * See docs/plans/v8-demo-prod-mode.md for the full design rationale.
