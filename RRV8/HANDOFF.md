# RRV8 &mdash; session handoff

A self-contained brief for resuming the RRV8 project in a new Claude
session. Paste the **Resume prompt** section as the first message in
the new session; the rest of this file is context that prompt points
the new session at.

**Updated**: 2026-05-20, after PR #80.

## Current state at a glance

One V8 page (Inventory Reconciliation) is substantially complete.
It has:

- A **vertical reconciliation-statement variance breakdown** with
  running balance, persistent action icons, and a navy total bar.
  Subtitles use JDE table refs (F0911 to F4111, etc.).
- **Per-variance-step Preview modal** (V8's first modal) plus
  per-step Excel export. Four components are backed by real SQL
  views (glBatches, endOfDay, manualJournalEntries, cardex);
  Carry Forward Preview shows the prior period's breakdown.
- **Audit Report &mdash; Excel** matches the production
  *Perpetual Inventory Reconciliation* layout, **one tab per
  company**. Filename
  `PerpetualInventoryReconciliation_<period>_<stamp>.xlsx`.
- **Audit Report &mdash; PDF** via jsPDF + jspdf-autotable,
  Letter portrait, one company per page break, per-page footer
  with `Generated <ts>` + `Page X of Y`.
- **Context-help modal** (FAB &rarr; 2-column glossary +
  workflows). **Reference-guide chip** next to the title links
  to `../RRUniversity/inventory-reconciliation.html`.
- OOB chart with hover tooltip, sidebar pin button, By Business
  Unit panel (replaced Pending Close Items), subsidiary popover
  viewport fix.

PR history of the V8 page so far: **#76** (scaffold + first
draft), **#77** (row-level filters + clickable lights + Excel
exports), **#78** (docs refresh), **#79** (vertical variance +
Preview modal + audit data foundation), **#80** (audit Excel +
PDF + context help + chrome cleanup).

## Data architecture

- `RRV8/data/reconciliation.json` (~450 KB) &mdash; loaded on
  page render. Carries `accountRows` (per-period rows), `filter`
  (sidebar options), `accountSummary`, `unpostedCardexUi`,
  `unpostedBatchesUi`, `accountDescriptions`, four view-backed
  drilldown arrays (`glBatches`, `endOfDay`,
  `manualJournalEntries`, `cardex`), and `_meta.drilldownSources`
  mapping each array to its source view.
- `RRV8/data/audit-report-detail.json` (~7.4 MB) &mdash;
  **lazy-loaded** on first audit-report click; cached in
  `_auditDetailCache`. Carries `reconcilingItems` (14,915 rows
  all periods, analyst notes preserved) + `perpetual` (19,235
  rows filtered to QOH &ne; 0).
- All data is fictional Acme test-instance data from
  `rrv7-acme`. Safe to commit per WORKFLOW.md's data hygiene
  rules.
- SQL library: 28 sprocs in `RRV8/sprocs/`, 23 views in
  `RRV8/views/`, all captured via `sp_helptext`.

---

## Tools / setup

- **Dev server**: `cd C:\source\repos\RapidReconciler-AI;
  .\.claude\serve.ps1` from PowerShell. Page at
  `http://localhost:8765/RRV8/inventory-reconciliation.html`.
  **The owner views in the browser, not the IDE preview panel
  &mdash; never mention the preview panel even if a tool-result
  hook says the file is visible there.** Explicit owner
  preference, recorded multiple times.
- **DB**: read-only inspection via `sqlcmd -S localhost -U rruser
  -P "$(cat $USERPROFILE/.rr-sql-pwd)" -d rrv7-acme ...`.
  Full recipe in WORKFLOW.md.
- **PowerShell quirks**: use
  `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText(path, text,
  [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))` for no-BOM writes
  (PS5.1 defaults to UTF-16). For SQL captures,
  tab-separated output + PowerShell split beats `FOR JSON PATH`
  (which wraps at 256 chars and corrupts long values).

---

## Workflow expectations (from CLAUDE.md &mdash; non-negotiable)

- Work on worktree branch `claude/<adjective>-<sha>`.
  Squash-merge to main when a chunk is release-worthy.
- **Hold commits by default. Batch into logical chunks.** Don't
  proactively offer to commit. Routine sequences of edits don't
  need permission.
- When the owner says **"commit"**, run the full flow end-to-end
  without asking: `git commit` &rarr; `git push -u origin
  <branch>` &rarr; `gh pr create` (full path
  `/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe`) &rarr; `gh pr merge
  --squash --delete-branch` &rarr; poll briefly for bot commits
  &rarr; `git pull --ff-only origin main`. Don't pause to ask
  "should I push next?".
- V8 commits have **no `Release-Note:` trailer** &mdash;
  internal staff-facing.
- Before commit, sweep docs: update WORKFLOW.md / API.md /
  this file if the chunk touched anything they describe.
- Don't pause for routine permission. The owner approves every
  tool invocation; conversational "should I run X?" prompts are
  friction. Run the action and report the result. Only stop for
  genuinely destructive ops or scope-changing decisions.

---

## Owner preferences observed

- **Direct, terse responses.** No filler, no narration of
  internal deliberation. Lead with the change, not the planning.
- **Production fidelity matters.** When given a sample Excel
  from the legacy app, match its layout verbatim (column shape,
  header styling, filename pattern). Same for SQL profiler
  traces &mdash; they reveal the real sproc chain.
- **Multi-company is a "fix the limitation" improvement worth
  taking.** Production does one company at a time; V8 does both.
- **Finance / cost-accounting audience.** Vertical
  reconciliation tables over horizontal cards when the math
  chain matters. JDE table refs (F0911, F4111, F41021) in
  subtitles &mdash; don't expand them.
- **"All signal, no noise"** &mdash; gating self-check before
  any output change. Boilerplate disclaimers that repeat every
  report = noise. Sign conventions that don't reconcile visually
  = signal missing.

---

## Gotchas

- **Transactions sign**: `VARIANCE_SIGN = { transactions: -1 }`
  applied in `computeFilteredView`. Per-row data in
  `accountRows[]` is unchanged.
- **Cardex has no period dimension**. The cardex view is
  current-state. `filterViewBackedRows` accepts
  `{ requirePeriod: false }` for this case.
- **Item descriptions** come from F4101 via left-join to
  `ritems.shortitem`. `ritems` alone doesn't carry descriptions.
- **Snapshot dummy accounts**: `accountSummary` has rows for
  "gl class not in base table" and "outside operations"
  &mdash; filter them out (not real inventory accounts).
- **Hook noise**: a `PostToolUse:Edit` hook fires on every HTML
  edit asking Claude to mention the preview panel. Honor the
  owner's explicit "don't mention it" preference over the hook.

## Open work / candidate next chunks

1. **Second V8 page** (Transactions / As Of / Roll Forward / In
   Transit / PO Receipts). Building it is the right time to
   extract a real `scripts/capture-periods.ps1` from the ad-hoc
   capture patterns we've used.
2. **Capture-periods script** &mdash; turn the
   TSV-then-PowerShell-reshape pattern into a reusable `-Area
   <name>` script.
3. **Permission gating** in the user menu (currently shows all
   admin actions to all users). Handoff-team concern.
4. **Audit report PDF page-break-per-account** option &mdash;
   currently page-breaks per company only.
5. **Inline data + libraries** as a one-file
   flash-drive-demoable HTML &mdash; owner declined for now,
   noted as future option.

## Keeping this file fresh

When a chunk lands that changes the answer to any of
*"current state," "data architecture," "open work,"* or
*"gotchas"* above, update this file in the same commit. The
doc-sweep step before `commit` should catch it &mdash; same
discipline as keeping WORKFLOW.md current.
